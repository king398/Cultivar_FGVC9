20/04/2022 - Wenesday
a)  Try out Effnetv2 b3 with 40 epochs ✅
b) read the Solving imagenet paper  Loss paper

21/04/2022 - Thursday
a) If effnetv2 b3 work try it out with Focal loss with gamma 2 (focal loss not work)
b) Try getting some new ideas  if get reply for mask then try to crop to mask (no reply)
c) More or less getting new ideas day ✅
d ) Effnet v2 m
22/04/2022 - Friday
a) Try out Asymetric loss or ConvNext
b) Try plotting embeddings
23/04/22 - Saturday
a) Try out Rand Augment or Cutmix + Mixup because of effnet_v2_b3 seems to overfit at 30 epochs , RandAugment First priority Because of ease of implmentation
24/04/22 - Sunday
a) Implement Pseudo labelling
b) Implement Changed TTA which uses diff augs


End of week Goal 1 , try to get into top 10 or atleast 0.90 as a score(if achivied next week will send out Emails to team up with any higher team)
0.90 as a blend target and 0.885 as a single model b3 target (just smart ideas not just increasing image size)


















Ideas To try
1) Focal loss
2) AsymmetricLossOptimized
3) Plotting image embeddings
4) Change tta to use diff type of Augs unlinke just flips and resize
5) Patch learning (hard to do because of limited resources but will try but if effnet v2 work it may be possible)
6) ConvNext, Swin v2,  NFnets
7) Hill climbing

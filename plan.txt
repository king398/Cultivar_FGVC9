Ideas To try
1) Focal loss (did not work)
2) AsymmetricLossOptimized
3) Plotting image embeddings
4) Change tta to use diff type of Augs unlinke just flips and resize (done and worked pretty well)
5) Patch learning (hard to do because of limited resources but will try but if effnet v2 work it may be possible)
6) ConvNext, Swin v2,  NFnets
7) Hill climbing
8) Knowledge Di stillation
9) Dataset own mean and std with mean =[0.3511794, 0.37462908, 0.2873578],std=[0.20823358, 0.2117826, 0.16226698],(worked on cv and lb)
10 ) AdamW(trying)
11) added CLAHE and affnine lets if it works (2 folds  done,not work on lb)
12) Higher image size for just inference (done and worked, we use get the formula ImageSizeI == ImageSizeT * 1.25)
